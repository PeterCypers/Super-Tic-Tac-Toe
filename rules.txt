based on the game introduced by Vsauce(a backup exists):
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_Na3a1ZrX7c

Setup:
Super tic tac toe begins with the usual 3x3 grid, in each of it's squares
another tic tac toe game is placed. Each square of the tic tac toe
is now also a tic tac toe game.

First move:
The first player can play in any of these 81 spaces.

Gameplay example:
First player chooses middle game top right square and draws down an X.
The next player must play in the square who's location corresponds with
the square the previous player chose -> They must play in the game at
the top right square.

If a player gets 3 in a row in one of the games, that entire square is marked
for them.

If a player wins 3 small games in a row they win the game.

If a player is ever forced to play in a game that's already won, they can't,
instead they get to play anywhere.

In case of draws:
If a small game draws, it remains un-earned (neither an X nor an O is placed over it). 
If the entire game ends with a draw, one tie-breaker option is to give the win to the player 
who won the most small games.
